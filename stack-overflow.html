			<p class="lead">Stack Overflow is an online community of developers and programmers and a platform for them to share their knowledge. The main objective of using Stack Overflow is for programmers to be able to ask questions and have them answered by other experts or general enthusiasts in the field. It is a community driven platform where every user starts off at the same level and earn their reputation by asking and answering relevant questions that are useful to the general community. This leads to the obvious result where users who have a high reputation are clearly experts in one or more fields. We decided to visualize this to see if we can find interesting insights.</p>

      <h2>Implementation <small></small></h2>
      <p>This was implemented using Gephi. Each point or dot in the map represents a user. Each user is assigned a certain z value in space that represents their reputation. This z value is directly represented in their position along the z axis. The users reputation is also displayed alongside the point. Questions are represented using lines drawn connecting the 2 users who asked and answered the question respectively. The line is colored using a gradient of red and blue. The blue end is connected to the user who asked the question while the red end is connected to the user who answered the question. This layout led to the above visualization.</p>
      <h2>Interesting Insights <small></small></h2>
      <p>It is clearly seen from the visualization that there is pattern in the way questions are answered. The graph is skewed such that the few users who have a very high reputation answer a majority of the questions while at the same time ask very few questions (almost none). People with lower reputation only ask questions. But what does this really indicate? It shows that there are a few good experts who are a part of the stack overflow community almost like philanthropists. They do not get any real rewards from answering questions and do not ask many questions either, again not getting any real rewards from being a part of stack overflow. Although users recieve a reputation, there is no obvious reward for receiving a high reputation. But it is because of these experts that a large population of developers are able to learn and have their programming problems fixed.</p>
