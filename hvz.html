						  <p class= "padding" align="justify">Humans vs Zombies (HvZ) is a zombie apocalypse game played on campuses across the world. It is essentially a game of tag but played by very large groups of people in wide open spaces. The premise of the game is to live in a fantasy world where a virus has attacked the human population that is slowly spreading like an epidemic. Over time the game has involved to include technology into the game play to facilitate communication and to keep track of players. It is a free game under the creatve commons license that any person, group or organization can adapt and play on their campus. The Georgia Tech campus has been conducting this game every semester since 2012.

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="padding col-12" align="justify">
						The main goal of this project was to research game play and design &amp; prototype a solution that would increase immersion into the game environment. We followed a <b>double-diamond</b> approach to the research and design of the project in order to acknowledge the wide scope of the problem space. Our only rule through the duration of the project was to let the research guide us to the solution. Our process had <b>continuous feedback</b> loops at every stage where we would receive input from UX experts as well as admins and players of the game.

				<div class="row">
					<h3 class="padding col-12">User Research<h3>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="padding col-6 col-m-12">
						<h4><i>Step 1:</i> Identifying User Characteristics</h4>
						<br><br>
						<p align="justify">We identified <b>active and passive participants</b> focusing on traits relevant to the game such as physical characteristics: athleticity, age, access to technology and presence on campus. Some other social factors that could differentiate between user groups were also included time, membership in academic organizations/peer groups, experience, etc. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="padding col-6 col-m-12">
						<h4><i>Step 2:</i> Defining Research Questions</h4>
						<br><br>
						<p align="justify">The purpose of identifying these research questions was to figure out what type of data we needed to collect and the methods we had to use to collect it. This could be <b>user volunteered</b> information through interviews, surveys or <b>ethnographic</b> data.</p><br>
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<div class="padding col-6 col-m-12">
						<h4><i>Step 3:</i> Identifying Social and Technical Context</h4>
						<br><br>
						<p align="justify">Social aspects of the environment and the community relate to the problem space in a game like HvZ where human interaction is a critical aspect to study. Technical context of the game is important to not just understand how the game is being played currently but also to understand what type of solutions can be implemented <b>feasibly</b>. These larger systems are important when designing for the users.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="padding col-6 col-m-12">
						<h4><i>Step 4:</i> Primary Data Collection</h4>
						<br><br>
						<p align="justify">We reviewed games from previous semesters by looking at Facebook groups, websites and other social media outlets as well as reviewed the official HvZ pages. We interviewed the administrators of the game and a few former players. We studied the rules of the game and paid attention to specific details that were emphasised in the rules. We studied how the game and the rules have evolved over the years in this <b>Pre-Game Research</b> phase.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="padding col-12">
						<h4><i>Step 5:</i>Task Analysis</h4>
						<p align="justify">
						This analysis was a combination of 3 aspects: </p>
						<ol class="padding">
							<li>Characteristics of the <b>tasks</b> performed by the users</li>
							<li>Characteristics of the <b>environment</b> in which the task is performed</li>
							<li>A heirarchical analysis of the <b>decision making</b> process in the task</li>
						</ol>
						<p align="justify">
						We followed this approach to identify and study how the user's current approach to the task and how this might influence our design eventually. Any existing systems that were in place had to be studied in order to understand if and how current solutions to problems work and perform a literature review of these systems.

						<h4><i>Step 6:</i>Initial Usability Criteria</h4>
						<p align="justify">
							We listed out principles that we would use eventually while evaluating our design. This formed a basic in/out list for our designs. 
							<ol class="padding">
								<li>Focus on the users and the tasks not the technology</li>

						<h4><i>Step 7:</i>Secondary Research</h4>
						<p align="justify">
							We conducted this stage of research closer to the actual game of HvZ played on campus. We wanted to obtain more complete and detailed data that best reflects the user’s problems. We structured our research in order to understand the user’s experience before, during and after the game. Major portion of our research was conducted during the game itself. Two members of our team participated in the game while the other two observed from the outside. Most of our research data comprised of ethnographic data collected through interviews.

						We first decoded all the qualitative data from recordings, interviews, diary studies, etc and segmented them into affinity notes. We constructed an affinity map through the bottom up or deductive approach. We noticed some common ideas among different participants and hence we grouped these together into common areas. The affinity diagram allowed us to more easily see trends in issues across the people we interviewed. It was also a good way to get a feel of the players’ general thoughts about the game. We used the quantitative data collected from the surveys to confirm our findings from our affinity map. We had collected data such as player's preference to play as human/zombie, their knowledge about campus, etc. from a large group of people and therefore we were able to supplement our findings from the smaller sample set of interviewees using this more representative data.

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-7 col-m-12 padding">
						<p align="justify">
							<ol class="padding">
								<li>A large number of players would choose to turn into a Zombie on the first day in order to play the “more dominant” role. This disrupted the normal play of events that is similar to a zombie apocalypse.</li>
								<li>In order to log that a player has been converted into a zombie, players must obtain a Player ID from the newly converted human, sign into the Georgia tech HvZ website and enter this player ID. Many times this process can be time consuming and can remove the player from the experience of the game. This causes a delay in players entering this information which also forced the newly converted human to be removed from the game until his conversion was logged.</li>
								<li>If players didnt own smart phones or if their phones ran out of battery, this was delayed even further.</li>
							</ol>
							We identified that all of these problems compromised the experience of the game and hence increasing immersion had to be our main focus.

						We began by splitting off and individually designing 20 <b>divergent</b> ideas and rapidly came up with more to solve that particular problem. We combined similar ideas that could work together in a single system to best solve the main problems identified in the affinity diagram. Through <b>collaborative ideation</b> and <b>narrative development</b>, acting out the story of how the concept is used, we honed in on our final design proposals. This allowed us to define features, address areas that might be problematic with the design as well us address issues with form factors and <b>accessibility</b>. We also focused on enhancing the player's experience in the game and increasing immersion and game feel and therefore refined our ideas keeping this in mind. We worked together as a group throughout the converging process so we could constantly build on each others’ ideas and <b>eliminate them</b> if we felt they did not address the problem well enough. Throughout the process we kept in mind the personas we had created since they best represented the people we observed through research. Particularly we wanted to keep in mind that we wanted to create an equally immersive experience for all the personas and did not want to skew the game towards one type of player. <br><br>
						Therefore, we kept all of these points in mind while narrowing down our ideas. The key method we used while doing so is by first dividing out 20 different ideas into groups based on the implementation. That is, we grouped designs based on form factor and <b>device to human ratio</b>. For example, designs that involved kiosks or screens around campus have a 1 to many ratio and are of a higher form factor as compared to wearable devices such as vests and watches. Once we grouped these designs together, we combined designs and <b>eliminated redundant features</b>. We then evaluated the smaller set of designs based on their usability, feasibility and of course how the increased the immersion of the game and how well they addressed the problems.

						<p align="justify">
							We had a peer evaluation session where we displayed each of our four solutions with story boards to depict how they would be used. Fellow HCI students, game players and faculty <b>voted</b> on the designs and gave feedback on each following which we evaluated the designs based on the following criteria<br>
						</p>
						<ol class="padding">
							<li><b>Feasability</b> vs <b>Usefulness</b></li>
							<li><b>Form Factor</b> - Inch vs Foot vs Yard</li>
							<li><b>Scale</b> - 1:1 device vs many:1 device</li>
							<li><b>Maintainability</b></li>
						</ol>
						<p align="justify">
							After evaluating our designs and obtaining feedback on them we zeroed in on our solution: A foot sized device, a kiosk, that will be placed in various locations across the campus that players can interact with in order to perform various tasks. We realised that such a device would not just be more feasable compared to a wearable but also easy to maintain for the game admins. It also eliminates the need for using a mobile phone while playing which provides the most immersive experience compared to the other solutions. By making use of <b>existing artifacts</b> such as college IDs we would be able to make the device usable by everyone without having to put in effort for setting up. Our objective of creating a design like this was to keep its usage to the minimum. Players should be able to complete their tasks in the least amount of time and focus on the game.

	      		Our prototype was a stationary kiosk, a physical machine that would count coins that signify either human stuns or zombie kills. After a user swipes his or her buzzcard (or for the sake of the prototype taps a general purpose rfid card) the machine will recognize the user’s identity and will display the player’s in-game statistics. If the player is a human he can choose to log stuns by inserting coins taken from zombies. Similarly if the player is a zombie he can choose to log kills by tapping the coin received from tagging humans. The machine will count the number of stuns or kills that are inputted and display the player’s updated game statistics when finished. The machine will then send this data via wifi to the HVZ website. This will allow users to track stuns and kills while keeping the player immersed in the experience of the game.

							We decided to use a Raspberry Pi with its 7-inch display in addition to an Arduino Uno to control the Input sensors and the LED lights. These are both <b>fast prototyping kits</b> that are easy to program in and are <b>flexible</b> in their usage. They are also small boards that are easy to fit in different form factors. We prototyped the outer shell of the kiosk using <b>available raw materials</b>: a camera tripod, laser cut cardboard and acrylic sheets and put them together using hot glue.

							We used Python's standard GUI library TKinter and MySQL for the development. We used a <b>"duct-tape and glue"</b> method of prototyping in order to quickly simulate the end to end experience of using the kiosk. We creating a <b>local database instead of hosting</b> it on a server. We <b>hard-coded authentication and authorization</b> to simulate the RFID scanning. And we relied on illustrations for most of the data on the screen only focusing on developing the <b>critical user journeys</b>.

We evaluated the prototype using the pre and post game survey to compare responses from the previous game as well as measure immersiveness using a survey by <cite>Jennetta et al</cite><sup> [1]</sup>. We measured basic values such as session time, errors, satisfaction, etc. to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our prototype.</p>

					Zombies are given a set of coins at the beginning of the day. Every time a zombie gets stunned he hands the human a coin. The humans collect these coins and the end of the day they can use this kiosk to feed the coins and collect HvZ bucks for their stuns. If a zombie runs out of coins for the day he is removed from the play. The kiosk can be used to record humans getting tagged. The zombie who tags the human collects an RFID tagged coin from the human and scans it at the kiosk.

					A large display will indicate to the public how many humans and zombies there are; it will also list top players. Students and teachers will be able to vote for humans or zombies; this will affect the stun timer in favor of the winnin team. A kiosk will also allow onlookers to support specific players by voting to send humans things that will help them such as delivery food, marshmallows or socks.

					Kiosks located throughout campus will allow zombies and humans to "control" certain areas. Players can scan their buzzcards at a kiosk at any time throughout the day and the team with the most unique scans controls the kiosk. At 3 set times throughout the day, players will receive 50 HVZ bucks for each territory their team controls. Lights on the kiosk will display which team owns the territory and by how much.

					Players will wear a "Flare Watch" that will act like a homing device. Humans or zombies can hit the flare button when they spot a player on the other team. A notification then goes to other zombies/humans. The watch then indicated the direction in which the flare came from. Players can also see the location on a map in a phone app. The location will fade over time to give a "Flare".
